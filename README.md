# MC-LangFix v0.5

MC-LangFix is a small resource pack designed to fix a multitude of bugs in Minecraft's English language files. These bugs have been designated as Low priority by Mojang, and for frankly good reason: they are minor translation and localization issues that have probably legitimately impacted the gameplay experience of at most a dozen total players, and only any that speak a dialect of English. This resource pack is not a critique of Mojang in anyway, *but* there is something to be said about the fact that these bugs were fixed in an afternoon.

## Download

Download this repository as-is and install it as a resource pack. Enable priority should not matter much, so long as it is higher than the default resource pack.

## Terms of Use

You may use and modify MC-LangFix as you please, so long as full attribution is maintained. Honestly I'm not sure why you would, but go ahead.

Mojang if you find this you know what to do. I'd like my name to be in extra large font in the credits.
